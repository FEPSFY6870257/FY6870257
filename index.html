  <p id="Abstract">
  Robotic surgery is one of the most important technological innovations in medicine. 
  This article will explore the impact of surgical robots both in terms of benefits 
  and challenges in various places, as well as looking into the future and advancements 
  in these procedures.Systems like the da Vinci have shown major benefits like greater 
  precision, lower rates of postoperative complications, and less recovery time. Moreover, 
  any new advances in the field of AI and machine learning will ultimately mean providing 
  increasingly more complex tasks on a higher level of decision-making ability and performing 
  actions without human input whatsoever. But these advances also pose pressing questions about 
  responsibility for mistakes, access imbalances between healthcare systems, and the risk of displacing 
  old-fashioned surgical skills. It concludes that while robotic surgery holds tremendous potential 
  to change medical practices, measures must be taken to define liability and enhance 
  training as these systems can impact the health system both negatively and positively.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p id="Introduction">
  Surgical robots have revolutionised healthcare with their precision and control. 
  In minimally invasive surgery but particularly where robotic-assisted surgical procedures 
  are used, studies show shorter hospital stays than with conventional methods by offering 
  less pain after the operation, few postoperative complications, and quicker recovery 
  (<a href="#ref-kucuk2018">Küçük, 2018</a>). Robots utilising AI and machine learning in the future, 
  such as pre-operative navigational tools, may further allow these robots to perform more complex surgical plans. 
  Moreover, as robots become increasingly autonomous, there will be questions surrounding 
  accountability of mistakes or negative outcomes—should the onus be on the manufacturer, 
  the surgeon, or the AI developed? This lack of clarity could have legal and ethical implications. Addressing 
  these challenges is crucial to adopting the use of surgical robots while ensuring ethical and moral integrity, 
  and safety in healthcare.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Benefits and Challenges">Benefits and Challenges</h3>
  <p id="Benefits and Challenges">
  Due to the implementation of robotic systems into surgery, numerous ethical, moral, 
  and even legal advantages were obtained. With regards to ethics, robotic surgeries 
  increase patient safety through improved precision and control that eliminates surgical 
  errors. The example especially for the da Vinci system which is a ‘system consists of a console 
  from which the surgeon remotely controls arms connected to a robotic cart beside the 
  patient,’ it has been adopted widely, with over 7,500 units installed worldwide and 
  millions of operations annually. <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows the da Vinci Surgical Robot in a hospital setting, 
  it’s been important that robotic surgery should ensure it provides accurate as well as safe assistance (<a href="#ref-kucuk2018">Küçük, 2018</a>).
  Studies also highlight the ability of these systems to minimise postoperative problems and reduce recovery times, which supports the moral aspect to 
  prioritise patient well-being and comfort (<a href="#ref-reddy2023">Reddy et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-rivero2023">Rivero-Moreno et al., 2023</a>). 
  In addition, because of the minimally invasive technology from robotic surgery, surgeons can get better results and shorter hospital stays with 
  fewer incisions and less damage to surrounding tissue while maintaining ethical care (<a href="#ref-kucuk2018">Küçük, 2018</a>). These are progressions 
  in preservation of a human services framework that is under huge strain to improve how patients experience the system.

  Robotic surgery is revolutionary, but it brings important challenges. Due to their high price, 
  these robots create a financial burden that brings up important questions about equal access 
  to healthcare, and this situation may worsen the existing disparity between well-funded institutions 
  and underserved communities, according to (<a href="#ref-reddy2023">Reddy et al., (2023)</a>). 
  It is important for many people that these developments remain accessible, and they should not 
  be limited to certain patients or facilities. An important challenge is holding people accountable 
  for errors or complications, as robotic surgeries caused 144 deaths and 1,391 injuries in the US 
  over a 14-year period (<a href="#ref-randell2015">Randell, 2015</a>). With the rise of artificial intelligence 
  granting more autonomy to robotic systems, the question that is raised by this situation is about who will be held 
  legally responsible for any problems that may occur. Unclear who holds liability—surgeons, manufacturers, or software 
  developers—creates complications for legal proceedings, and risks the trust necessary for patients in surgery 
  (<a href="#ref-rivero2023">Rivero-Moreno et al., 2023</a>). Training poses a major challenge. Wide-ranging training must 
  be undergone by surgeons to master these systems. Inconsistent access to training resources can affect the quality of care in 
  many institutions (<a href="#ref-kucuk2018">Küçük, 2018</a>). Additionally, the dependency on robotics may diminish manual surgical 
  skills over time, raising questions about preparedness in situations where robotic systems fail. Addressing these challenges will be 
  important in the growing future of surgical robots.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="Future of Surgical Robots">Future of Surgical Robots</h3>
  <p id="Futire of Surgical Robots">
  When it comes to surgical robotics, the potential for AI and robotics to combine for 
  even more accurate, less invasive surgeries is boundless. This includes, but is not 
  limited to, robotic systems that can perform surgeries autonomously, robots that measure 
  and calibrate, and robotics that learn and teach based on unique individual patients. 
  Such innovations will extend the effectiveness of surgical robotics while reducing human 
  error and offering a greater capacity for surgical robots working in situations that would 
  be too dangerous for human operation—remote surgeries with challenging access points or 
  surgeries on more vulnerable populations that would never be candidates for high-risk 
  surgical operation. Furthermore, AI-driven surgical robots and systems can foster greater engagement 
  for pre- and post-op procedures, where machine learning systems can evaluate what worked and what 
  did not, in real time (<a href="#ref-bennett2022">Bennett et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-rai2021">Rai et al., 2021</a>).
  </p>

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p id="Conclusion">
  In conclusion, robotic surgical technology has a tremendous impact on healthcare; 
  the precision it provides and more efficient recovery times. Also, as AI and machine learning progress, 
  there is the potential for further exciting possibilities, though they do pose ethical, moral, and legal dilemmas. 
  However, as robotic systems evolve and reach their full potential, the deployment globally will be widespread, 
  for which topics such as appropriate access, defined accountability, and adequate training 
  need to be addressed to fully realise these benefits and ensure that surgical care is 
  increased with robotic-based systems safely and effectively.
