<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3> 
   <p class="ex1">
   <pre>
     Robotic surgery, a groundbreaking advancement in medical technology, has redefined the landscape of surgical procedures. 
     This article plans to delve into impact of surgical robots both in both benefits and challenges in different, also to explore the future and development of these 
     procedures. Systems like the da Vinci, have demonstrated significant advantages such as enhanced precision, reduced postoperative complications, and shorter recovery 
     times. Furthermore, future developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning promise even greater capabilities 
     including autonomous procedures and improved decision-making processes. However, these developments also raise critical questions regarding accountability for errors, 
     access disparities between healthcare institutions, and the potential removal of traditional surgical skills. 
     It concludes that while robotic surgery holds tremendous potential to change medical practices measures must be taken to define 
     liability and enhance training as these systems can impact the health system both negatively and positively.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
      Surgical robots have transformed healthcare, offering unmatched precision and control. Especially in minimally invasive procedures, 
      studies indicate that robotic-assisted surgeries can reduce hospital stays compared to traditional methods by providing less discomfort after operations,
      reduced postoperative complications and faster recovery times<a href="#ref-kucuk2018"">(Küçük, 2018)</a>. Future advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning could 
      enable these robots to perform even more complex surgical plans that can implement pre-defined surgical plans with high precision, reducing the need for real-time human 
      intervention<a href="#ref-bhandari2020">(Bhandari, Zeffiro, and Reddiboina, 2020)</a>. Additionally, as robots become more autonomous, questions emerge about who is accountable 
      for any errors or adverse outcomes—should responsibility lie with the manufacturer, the surgeon, or the AI system itself? This lack of clarity on accountability could 
      have legal and ethical implications. Addressing these challenges is crucial to adopting the use of surgical robots while ensuring ethical and moral integrity, and safety in 
      healthcare.

  <h3 id="Benefits and Challenges">Benefits and Challenges</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
      The integration of robotic systems into surgery has brought significant ethical, moral, and legal benefits. 
      From an ethical perspective, robotic surgeries enhance patient safety by reducing surgical errors by improved precision and control. 
      Particularly the da Vinci system which is a ‘system consists of a console from which the surgeon remotely controls arms connected to a 
      robotic cart beside the patient’ it has been widely adopted, with over 7,500 units installed globally and millions of surgeries performed annually, 
      <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows the da Vinci Surgical Robot used in a hospital setting, it’s been crucial to make sure that robotic surgery continues to deliver precise
      and safe assistance<a href="#ref-goh2022">(Goh and Ali, 2022)</a>;<a href="#ref-kucuk2018">(Küçük, 2018)</a>. Studies also highlight the ability of these systems to minimise
      postoperative problems and reduce recovery times, which supports the moral aspect to prioritise patient well-being and comfort<a href="#ref-reddy2023">(Reddy et al., 2023)</a>;
      <a href="#ref-rivero2023">(Rivero-Moreno et al., 2023)</a>. Furthermore, robotic surgery's minimally invasive nature enables surgeons to perform procedures with fewer incisions and 
      less tissue damage, leading to better outcomes and shorter hospital stays, therefore keeping ethical standards of care<a href="#ref-kucuk2018">(Küçük, 2018)</a>.

  </figure>
  
  <pre>
     The adoption of robotic surgery, while revolutionary, also presents significant challenges. The financial burden 
      these robots can create due to their price could raise questions about equal access and potentially worsen the existing 
      disparity between well-funded institutions and underserved communities in healthcare<a href="#ref-reddy2023">(Reddy et al., 2023)</a>. Morally, ensuring that 
      these developments are accessible and not limited to specific patients or facilities is crucial. Another critical challenge is accountability 
      for errors or complications as robotic surgeries were ‘involved in 144 deaths and 1,391 injuries in the US during a 14-year period.’<a href="#ref-randell2015">(Randell, 2015)</a>. 
      With increasing autonomy in robotic systems through artificial intelligence, the question arises: who has the legal responsibility for any issues? 
      This lack of clarity on whether liability rests with the surgeon, the manufacturer, or the software developers complicates legal proceedings and risks the 
      trust a patient requires in a surgery<a href="#ref-rivero2023">(Rivero-Moreno et al., 2023)</a>. Training is another significant obstacle. Surgeons must undergo extensive training to 
      master these systems, and inconsistency in access to training resources can affect the quality of care across institutions<a href="#ref-kucuk2018">(Küçük, 2018)</a>. Additionally, the 
      dependency on robotics may diminish manual surgical skills over time, raising questions about preparedness in situations where robotic systems fail. 
      Addressing these challenges will be important in the growing future of surgical robots.
  </pre>
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="Future of Surgical Robots">Future of Surgical Robots</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
      The future of surgical robots is poised to revolutionise the medical field, use advanced artificial intelligence (AI) with robotic 
      systems to deliver precise and minimally invasive procedures. These emerging innovations show for more enhanced capabilities 
      such as autonomous task execution, real-time decision-making, and personalised surgical approaches. These progresses will likely 
      help reduce human error and allow for even more safe use of robots and expand access to complex surgeries in 
      remote or resource-limited areas that normally would have a higher risk when being performed by a human surgeon. 
      AI-integrated systems, particularly those leveraging machine learning algorithms are also expected to improve preoperative planning and 
      postoperative evaluations which will allow for constant improvement of the use and make procedures more trustful and safer over the 
      years to come 2022 <a href="#ref-bennett2022">(Bennett et al., 2022)</a>.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
      In conclusion, robotic surgery has greatly helped healthcare by improving accuracy and patient recovery. Also, with ongoing 
      AI and machine learning developments, the potential for further breakthroughs is immense but comes with ethical, moral, and 
      legal considerations. Therefore, to fully realise these benefits it is essential to address issues like fair access, defined 
      accountability, and comprehensive training, ensuring that robotic systems enhance surgical care safely and effectively to be able 
      for these systems to be mass adopted globally for it to reach its full potential.
